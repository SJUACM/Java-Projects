# Jumpman

This is a platformer game I made for my AP Java class back in high school called Jumpman. It is basically a combination of Minecraft, Mario, and even has some Flappy Bird components. It has a lot of different sound effects and has 3 levels that are considerable tough to beat. Have fun!

To start the game, make a new Java Project in your IDE and then copy all the files from this project to the src folder of the java project you made. Then, run the `Game.java` file.
